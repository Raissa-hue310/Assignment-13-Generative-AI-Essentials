# Assignment-13-Generative-AI-Essentials

understanding of Generative AI basics, focusing on its key concepts, the architecture of models like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), and their practical applications.

# Assignment 13: Generative AI Essentials

This project demonstrates a Generative AI text generation workflow using
the **Shakespeare Tiny Dataset** and a **TensorFlow/Keras LSTM model**.

## Project Overview

-   Trains a character-level generative model.
-   Uses LSTM architecture to predict next characters.
-   Generates Shakespeare-style text.
-   Includes a simple content creation demo.

## Files Included

-   `notebook.ipynb` -- Full Google Colab notebook.
-   `Assignment_13_Generative_AI_Report.docx` -- Full assignment report.
-   `README.md` -- Project documentation.

## Technologies Used

-   Python
-   TensorFlow/Keras
-   NumPy / Pandas
-   Shakespeare tiny dataset

## How to Run

1.  Open Google Colab.
2.  Upload the notebook or paste the provided code.
3.  Run all cells.
4.  Modify the `seed_text` in the generation function to test custom
    outputs.

## Key Concepts Covered

-   Generative Artificial Intelligence
-   GPT architecture principles
-   Tokenization and sequence modeling
-   LSTM neural networks for text generation
-   Ethical considerations of AI
